# Phantasy Star Universe Toolset
PSULib, the PSU Generic Parser, and other smallish derived projects

# What's Included
  - **PSULib**: DLL containing all of the file classes.
  - **PSU Generic Parser**: Generalized research/editing tool for PSU (and \_sometimes\_ the portable games). Entirely focused on individual files--no correlation is done at all (e.g while you can edit the weapon stats and you can edit the weapon star ratings, you cannot edit these two things simultaneously as they are in separate files). Primarily focused on AotI PC; while 360 archives can be read, most files in those archives cannot.
  - **Mission Builder**: Used to compile individual missions from a quest NBL and zone NBL(s).

# Supported Data
Gameplay:
  - itemCommonInfo.xnr (view/edit): Item ID/rarity mapping file.
  - itemBulletParam\*.xnr (view/edit): Bullet Art parameter files. AOTI/PSP1 only.
  - itemSkillParam\*.xnr (view/edit): Skill parameter files. AOTI/PSP1 only.
  - itemTechParam0(1-6)\*.xnr (view/edit): Technic parameter files for standard technics. Does not include support for itemTechParam11\_EnemyB.xnr. AOTI/PSP1 only.
  - itemLineUnitParam.xnr (view/edit): Unit parameter file. AOTI/PSP1 only.
  - itemPartsParam.xnr (view/edit): CAST Parts parameter file. AOTI/PSP1 only.

  - itemObjectDrop.xnr (present in PSULib, no UI): Box/tree/etc drop tables. AOTI only.
  - EnemyLevelBaseParam.xnr (view/edit): Base enemy stat table.
  - Think\*Dragon.xnr (view only, very rough): AI control file for De Ragan/De Ragnus/Zoal Goug/Alteraz Gohg. Does the bare minimum of parsing, most data is still un-annotated.

  - XNT texture lists (view/edit): Map model texture IDs to XVR files
  - NOM animations (view only, very rough): Player animations for PSU (PC/PS2) and PSP1/2/i. Does the bare minimum of parsing, most data is still unknown.
